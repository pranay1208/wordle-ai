# wordle-ai

A discord bot that makes an attempt to solve a wordle puzzle using constraint satisfaction.

## Usage

Simply clone and run `python src/main.py [arg]` locally to start the program.

You can pass in an optional command line argument to make it guess that word. If no arguemnt is passed, it will guess Wordle's word of the day

```

## Future Work

1. Integrate with Discord
2. Update constraint satisfaction heuristics to pick the word that eliminates most options
3. Include the 'non-answer' words from Wordle into engine
```
